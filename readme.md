# Hi, it's Greg. I have created an application that calculates the best route to visit all places that I have planned. This app will calculate the route based on the user's input. You can choose up to 10 waypoints on your way. The application will calculate the best route and will give you the detailed description of each step of your road trip. Also, you will see the total duration of the trip and total distance that you will travel during the trip. This app can be also used to calculate the daily miles driven if you want to deduct some of your income for travel.
# Side feature of the app is to show your current location. This will only work if you agree to share your location in the browser.
# If you don't specify the origin, the app will calculate the route your current location.

# Technologies used in the app:
  1. Ruby
  2. Sinatra Server
  3. Google Maps API
  4. JavaScript
  5. Foundation Framework
  6. Ruby gem "dotenv" for keeping the API key in the environment
  7. Application deployed in production using Heroku

# To start the application:
  1. Bundle the ruby gems:
    $ bundle
  2. Start the server:
    $ ruby server.rb
